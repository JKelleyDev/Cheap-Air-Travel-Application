## Introduction: 
Our project aims to develop an Airline Management System using Java and Eclipse. This system will offer a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of an airline's operations, including flight destination, passenger information handling, transactions, baggage,  boarding passes, and additional passenger options. The system will provide a user friendly  interface for both administrators and users, ensuring a smooth and efficient operations for the airline.
### Objectives:
•	Develop a robust and user-friendly interface for managing airline operations.  
•	Design a GUI for flight scheduling, and passenger handling.  
•	Ensure data integrity and security by implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.  
•	Provide booking confirmations and other relevant information at time of booking.  
•	Optimize system performance to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently. 
•	Facilitate easy integration with other systems such as payments, option selections, and meal selections.  

### Features: 
•	Booking Management: Enables users to search for flights, book tickets, and manage their bookings.    
•	Passenger Handling: Stores passenger information securely and manages check-in processes.  
•	Notifications: Sends automated notifications to users regarding booking confirmations, flight delays, and other relevant updates.  
•	Integration: Supports integration with external systems for payment processing, flight tracking, and other services.  

## Conclusion: 
The proposed Airline Management System will streamline the operations of the airline, enhance user experience, and improve overall efficiency. By leveraging modern technologies and best practices, we aim to deliver a high-quality solution that meets the needs of both the airline and its passengers
